=head1 NAME

perlxstypemap - Perl XS C/Perl type mapping

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=begin original

The more you think about interfacing between two languages, the more
you'll realize that the majority of programmer effort has to go into
converting between the data structures that are native to either of
the languages involved.  This trumps other matter such as differing
calling conventions because the problem space is so much greater.
There are simply more ways to shove data into memory than there are
ways to implement a function call.

=begin original

Perl XS' attempt at a solution to this is the concept of typemaps.
At an abstract level, a Perl XS typemap is nothing but a recipe for
converting from a certain Perl data structure to a certain C
data structure and vice versa.  Since there can be C types that
are sufficiently similar to warrant converting with the same logic,
XS typemaps are represented by a unique identifier, henceforth
called an   <XS type> in this document.  You can then tell the XS
compiler that multiple C types are to be mapped with the same
XS typemap.

=begin original

In your XS code, when you define an argument with a C type or when
you are using a C<CODE:> and an C<OUTPUT:> section together with a
C return type of your XSUB, it'll be the typemapping mechanism that
makes this easy.

=head2 Anatomy of a typemap

(typemap の構造)

=begin original

In more practical terms, the typemap is a collection of code
fragments which are used by the B<xsubpp> compiler to map C function
parameters and values to Perl values.  The typemap file may consist
of three sections labelled C<TYPEMAP>, C<INPUT>, and C<OUTPUT>.
An unlabelled initial section is assumed to be a C<TYPEMAP> section.
The INPUT section tells the compiler how to translate Perl values
into variables of certain C types.  The OUTPUT section tells the
compiler how to translate the values from certain C types into values
Perl can understand.  The TYPEMAP section tells the compiler which
of the INPUT and OUTPUT code fragments should be used to map a given
C type to a Perl value.  The section labels C<TYPEMAP>, C<INPUT>, or
C<OUTPUT> must begin in the first column on a line by themselves,
and must be in uppercase.

=end original

より実際的な用語として、typemap は C 関数の引数と値を Perl の値に
マッピングするために B<xsubpp> コンパイラによって使われるコード片の集合
(collection)です。
typemap ファイルは C<TYPEMAP>, C<INPUT>, C<OUTPUT> というラベルの付いた
三つのセクションから構成されます。
ラベルのついていない初期化セクションは、C<TYPEMAP> であるかのように
仮定されます。
INPUT セクションは、コンパイラに対して Perl の値をどのように
(幾つかある) C の型に変換するかを指示します。
OUTPUT セクションは、コンパイラに対してどのようにして C の型を Perl が
認識できる値に変換するのかを指示します。
TYPEMAP セクションは、コンパイラに対して指示された C の型を Perl の値に
マッピングするのに使うべき INPUT セクションもしくは OUTPUT セクションに
あるコード片を指示します。
セクションラベル C<TYPEMAP>, C<INPUT>, C<OUTPUT> は行の先頭におかれ、
大文字でなければなりません。

=begin original

Here's a more complicated example: suppose that you wanted
C<struct netconfig> to be blessed into the class C<Net::Config>.
One way to do this is to use underscores (_) to separate package
names, as follows:

=end original

もっと複雑な例を挙げましょう。
C<struct netconfig> を C<Net::Config> というクラスに bless したいと
考えていると仮定しましょう。
これを行うやり方の一つは、アンダースコア(_)を以下の様にパッケージ名を
区切るために使うというものです。

  typedef struct netconfig * Net_Config;

=begin original

And then provide a typemap entry C<T_PTROBJ_SPECIAL> that maps
underscores to double-colons (::), and declare C<Net_Config> to be of
that type:

=end original

それからアンダースコアをダブルコロン(::)にマップする typemap
エントリー C<T_PTROBJ_SPECIAL> を用意して、C<Net_Config> をその型と
して宣言します。

  TYPEMAP
  Net_Config      T_PTROBJ_SPECIAL
  
  INPUT
  T_PTROBJ_SPECIAL
    if (sv_derived_from($arg, \"${(my $ntt=$ntype)=~s/_/::/g;\$ntt}\")){
      IV tmp = SvIV((SV*)SvRV($arg));
      $var = INT2PTR($type, tmp);
    }
    else
      croak(\"$var is not of type ${(my $ntt=$ntype)=~s/_/::/g;\$ntt}\")
  
  OUTPUT
  T_PTROBJ_SPECIAL
    sv_setref_pv($arg, \"${(my $ntt=$ntype)=~s/_/::/g;\$ntt}\",
                 (void*)$var);

=begin original

The INPUT and OUTPUT sections substitute underscores for double-colons
on the fly, giving the desired effect.  This example demonstrates some
of the power and versatility of the typemap facility.

=end original

INPUT セクションと OUTPUT セクションはアンダースコアをダブルコロンへ
その場で置換して、期待される効果をもたらします。
この例では typemap 機構の威力と適用範囲の広さを例示します。

=begin original

The C<INT2PTR> macro (defined in perl.h) casts an integer to a pointer
of a given type, taking care of the possible different size of integers
and pointers.  There are also C<PTR2IV>, C<PTR2UV>, C<PTR2NV> macros,
to map the other way, which may be useful in OUTPUT sections.

=end original

(perl.h に定義されている) C<INT2PTR> マクロは、整数から与えられた型の
ポインタへのキャストを、整数とポインタとのサイズが異なる可能性を
考慮しつつ行います。
また、OUTPUT セクションで有用かもしれない、他の方法でマッピングする、
C<PTR2IV>, C<PTR2UV>, C<PTR2NV> マクロもあります。

=head2 The Role of the typemap File in Your Distribution

=begin original

The default typemap in the F<lib/ExtUtils> directory of the Perl source
contains many useful types which can be used by Perl extensions.  Some
extensions define additional typemaps which they keep in their own directory.
These additional typemaps may reference INPUT and OUTPUT maps in the main
typemap.  The B<xsubpp> compiler will allow the extension's own typemap to
override any mappings which are in the default typemap.  Instead of using
an additional F<typemap> file, typemaps may be embedded verbatim in XS
with a heredoc-like syntax.  See the documentation on the C<TYPEMAP:> XS
keyword.

=end original

Perl のソースの F<lib/ExtUtils> ディレクトリにあるデフォルトの typemap は
Perl のエクステンションから使うことのできるたくさんの便利な型があります。
一部のエクステンションではそれに固有のディレクトリに、typemap に対する
追加の定義を置いています。
これらの追加された typemap はメインの typemap にある INPUT や OUTPUT の
マッピングを参照することができます。
B<xsubpp> コンパイラは、エクステンションに固有の typemap が
デフォルトのtypemapにあるマッピングをオーバーライドすることを許しています。

=head2 Sharing typemaps Between CPAN Distributions

=begin original

Starting with ExtUtils::ParseXS version 3.13_01 (comes with perl 5.16
and better), it is rather easy to share typemap code between multiple
CPAN distributions. The general idea is to share it as a module that
offers a certain API and have the dependent modules declare that as a
built-time requirement and import the typemap into the XS. An example
of such a typemap-sharing module on CPAN is
C<ExtUtils::Typemaps::Basic>. Two steps to getting that module's
typemaps available in your code:

This means that you can embed Perl code in your typemap (C) code using
constructs such as
C<${ perl code that evaluates to scalar reference here }>. A common
use case is to generate error messages that refer to the true function
name even when using the ALIAS XS feature:

This can be used to store bytes in the string component of the

bytes themselves are just stored in the SV. It is assumed that the C

location).  If the pointer is pointing to something that is
represented by 8 bytes then those 8 bytes are stored in the SV (and
length() will report a value of 8). This entry is similar to T_OPAQUE.

Perl using T_OPAQUE rather than T_IV the underlying bytes representing
the integer will be stored in the SV but the actual integer value will
not be available. i.e. The data is opaque to perl.

Since the details are all up to the XS author (the typemap user),

The most commonly seen solution has been to allocate memory for
N+1 pointers and assign C<NULL> to the (N+1)th to facilitate
