=begin original

perl583delta - what is new for perl v5.8.3

=end original

perl v5.8.3 での変更点

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=begin original

This document describes differences between the 5.8.2 release and
the 5.8.3 release.

=end original

このドキュメントは 5.8.2 リリースと 5.8.3 リリースの変更点を記述しています。

=begin original

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.6.1, first read
the L<perl58delta>, which describes differences between 5.6.0 and
5.8.0, and the L<perl581delta> and L<perl582delta>, which describe differences
between 5.8.0, 5.8.1 and 5.8.2

=end original

もしそれよりも前のリリース, 例えば 5.6.1 等からアップデートするのなら、
5.6.0 と 5.8.0 との違いが書かれている L<perl58delta> および、
5.8.0, 5.8.1, 5.8.2 との違いが書かれている L<perl581delta>,
L<perl582delta> を読んでおいた方がよいでしょう。

=head1 Incompatible Changes

(互換性のない変更)

=begin original

There are no changes incompatible with 5.8.2.

=end original

5.8.2 との互換性のない変更はありません。

=head1 Core Enhancements

(Core の拡張)

=begin original

A C<SCALAR> method is now available for tied hashes. This is called when
a tied hash is used in scalar context, such as

=end original


    if (%tied_hash) {
	...
    }


=begin original

The old behaviour was that %tied_hash would return whatever would have been
returned for that hash before the hash was tied (so usually 0). The new
behaviour in the absence of a SCALAR method is to return TRUE if in the
middle of an C<each> iteration, and otherwise call FIRSTKEY to check if the
hash is empty (making sure that a subsequent C<each> will also begin by
calling FIRSTKEY). Please see L<perltie/SCALAR> for the full details and
caveats.

=end original


=head1 Modules and Pragmata

(モジュールとプラグマ)

=over 4

=item CGI

=item Cwd

=item Digest

=item Digest::MD5

=item Encode

=item File::Spec

=item FindBin

=begin original

A function C<again> is provided to resolve problems where modules in different
directories wish to use FindBin.

=end original


=item List::Util

=begin original

You can now weaken references to read only values.

=end original


=item Math::BigInt

=item PodParser

=item Pod::Perldoc

=item POSIX

=item Unicode::Collate

=item Unicode::Normalize

=item Test::Harness

=item threads::shared

=begin original

C<cond_wait> has a new two argument form. C<cond_timedwait> has been added.

=end original


=back

=head1 Utility Changes

(ツールの変更)

=begin original

C<find2perl> now assumes C<-print> as a default action. Previously, it
needed to be specified explicitly.

=end original


=begin original

A new utility, C<prove>, makes it easy to run an individual regression test
at the command line. C<prove> is part of Test::Harness, which users of earlier
Perl versions can install from CPAN.

=end original


=head1 New Documentation

(新しいドキュメント)

=begin original

The documentation has been revised in places to produce more standard manpages.

=end original


=begin original

The documentation for the special code blocks (BEGIN, CHECK, INIT, END)
has been improved.

=end original


=head1 Installation and Configuration Improvements

=begin original

Perl now builds on OpenVMS I64

=end original


=head1 Selected Bug Fixes

=begin original

Using substr() on a UTF8 string could cause subsequent accesses on that
string to return garbage. This was due to incorrect UTF8 offsets being
cached, and is now fixed.

=end original


=begin original

join() could return garbage when the same join() statement was used to
process 8 bit data having earlier processed UTF8 data, due to the flags
on that statement's temporary workspace not being reset correctly. This
is now fixed.

=end original


=begin original

C<$a .. $b> will now work as expected when either $a or $b is C<undef>

=end original


=begin original

Using Unicode keys with tied hashes should now work correctly.

=end original


=begin original

Reading $^E now preserves $!. Previously, the C code implementing $^E
did not preserve C<errno>, so reading $^E could cause C<errno> and therefore
C<$!> to change unexpectedly.

=end original


=begin original

Reentrant functions will (once more) work with C++. 5.8.2 introduced a bugfix
which accidentally broke the compilation of Perl extensions written in C++

=end original


=head1 New or Changed Diagnostics

=begin original

The fatal error "DESTROY created new reference to dead object" is now
documented in L<perldiag>.

=end original


=head1 Changed Internals

=begin original

The hash code has been refactored to reduce source duplication. The
external interface is unchanged, and aside from the bug fixes described
above, there should be no change in behaviour.

=end original


=begin original

C<hv_clear_placeholders> is now part of the perl API

=end original


=begin original

Some C macros have been tidied. In particular macros which create temporary
local variables now name these variables more defensively, which should
avoid bugs where names clash.

=end original


=begin original

<signal.h> is now always included.

=end original


=head1 Configuration and Building

=begin original

C<Configure> now invokes callbacks regardless of the value of the variable
they are called for. Previously callbacks were only invoked in the
C<case $variable $define)> branch. This change should only affect platform
maintainers writing configuration hints files.

=end original


=head1 Platform Specific Problems

=begin original

The regression test ext/threads/shared/t/wait.t fails on early RedHat 9
and HP-UX 10.20 due to bugs in their threading implementations.
RedHat users should see https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2003-136.html
and consider upgrading their glibc.

=end original


=head1 Known Problems

=begin original

Detached threads aren't supported on Windows yet, as they may lead to 
memory access violation problems.

=end original


=begin original

There is a known race condition opening scripts in C<suidperl>. C<suidperl>
is neither built nor installed by default, and has been deprecated since
perl 5.8.0. You are advised to replace use of suidperl with tools such
as sudo ( http://www.courtesan.com/sudo/ )

=end original


=begin original

We have a backlog of unresolved bugs. Dealing with bugs and bug reports
is unglamorous work; not something ideally suited to volunteer labour,
but that is all that we have.

=end original


=begin original

The perl5 development team are implementing changes to help address this
problem, which should go live in early 2004.

=end original


=head1 Future Directions

=begin original

Code freeze for the next maintenance release (5.8.4) is on March 31st 2004,
with release expected by mid April. Similarly 5.8.5's freeze will be at
the end of June, with release by mid July.

=end original

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the B<perlbug>
program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down
to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the
output of C<perl -V>, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be
analysed by the Perl porting team.  You can browse and search
the Perl 5 bugs at http://bugs.perl.org/

=end original

もしまだ報告されていないバグだと確信したら、そのリリースに含まれている
perlbug プログラムをを実行してください。
バグの再現スクリプトを十分小さく、しかし有効なコードに切りつめることを
意識してください。バグレポートは perl -V の出力と一緒に
perlbug@perl.org に送られ Perl porting チームによって解析されます。
Perl 5 のバグについては http://bugs.perl.org/ で閲覧及び
検索することができます。
