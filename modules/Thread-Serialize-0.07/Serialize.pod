=head1 NAME

Thread::Serialize - serialize data-structures between threads

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Thread::Serialize;    # export freeze() and thaw()

  use Thread::Serialize (); # must call fully qualified subs

  my $frozen = freeze( any data structure );
  any data structure = thaw( $frozen );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

                  *** A note of CAUTION ***

 This module only functions on Perl versions 5.8.0 and later.
 And then only when threads are enabled with -Dusethreads.  It
 is of no use with any version of Perl before 5.8.0 or without
 threads enabled.

                  *************************

The Thread::Serialize module is a library for centralizing the routines
used to serialize data-structures between threads.  Because of this central
location, other modules such as L<Thread::Conveyor>, L<Thread::Pool> or
L<Thread::Tie> can benefit from the same optimilizations that may take
place here in the future.

=head1 SUBROUTINES

There are only two subroutines.

=head2 freeze

 my $frozen = freeze( $scalar );

 my $frozen = freeze( @array );

The "freeze" subroutine takes all the parameters passed to it, freezes them
and returns a frozen representation of what was given.  The parameters can
be scalar values or references to arrays or hashes.  Use the L<thaw>
subroutine to obtain the original data-structure back.

=head2 thaw

 my $scalar = thaw( $frozen );

 my @array = thaw( $frozen );

The "thaw" subroutine returns the data-structure that was frozen with a call
to L<freeze>.  If called in a scalar context, only the first element of the
data-structure that was passed, will be returned.  Otherwise the entire
data-structure will be returned.

It is up to the developer to make sure that single argument calls to L<freeze>
are always matched by scalar context calls to L<thaw>.

=head1 OPTIMIZATIONS

To reduce memory and CPU usage, this module uses L<load>.  This causes
subroutines only to be compiled in a thread when they are actually needed at
the expense of more CPU when they need to be compiled.  Simple benchmarks
however revealed that the overhead of the compiling single routines is not
much more (and sometimes a lot less) than the overhead of cloning a Perl
interpreter with a lot of subroutines pre-loaded.
