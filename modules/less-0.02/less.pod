=head1 DESCRIPTION

just can't know. Consult your documentation on everything you're
currently using.

=head1 FOR MODULE AUTHORS

=begin original

L<less> has been in the core as a "joke" module for ages now and it
hasn't had any real way to communicating any information to
anything. Thanks to Nicholas Clark we have user pragmas (see
L<perlpragma>) and now C<less> can do something.

=begin original

You can probably expect your users to be able to guess that they can
request less CPU or memory or just "less" overall.

=begin original

If the user didn't specify anything, it's interpreted as having used
the C<please> tag. It's up to you to make this useful.

=head2 C<< BOOLEAN = less->of( FEATURE ) >>

=begin original

The class method C<< less->of( NAME ) >> returns a boolean to tell you
whether your user requested less of something.

  if ( less->of( 'CPU' ) ) {
      ...
  }
  elsif ( less->of( 'memory' ) ) {

  }

=head2 C<< FEATURES = less->of() >>

=begin original

If you don't ask for any feature, you get the list of features that
the user requested you to be nice to. This has the nice side effect
that if you don't respect anything in particular then you can just ask
for it and use it like a boolean.
