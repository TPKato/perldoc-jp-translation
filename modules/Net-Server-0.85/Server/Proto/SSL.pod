=head1 NAME

  Net::Server::Proto::SSL - adp0 - Net::Server SSL protocol.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

See L<Net::Server::Proto>.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Experimental.  If anybody has any successes or ideas for
improvment under SSL, please email <perl.ssl@seamons.com>.
This is extremely alpha.

Protocol module for Net::Server.  This module implements a
secure socket layer over tcp (also known as SSL).
See L<Net::Server::Proto>.

There is a limit inherent from using IO::Socket::SSL,
namely that only one SSL connection can be maintained by
Net::Server.  However, Net::Server should also be able to
maintain any number of TCP, UDP, or UNIX connections in
addition to the one SSL connection.

Additionally, getline support is very limited and writing
directly to STDOUT will not work.  This is entirely dependent
upon the implementation of IO::Socket::SSL.  getline may work
but the client is not copied to STDOUT under SSL.  It is suggested
that clients sysread and syswrite to the client handle
(located in $self->{server}->{client} or passed to the process_request
subroutine as the first argument).

=head1 PARAMETERS

In addition to the normal Net::Server parameters, any of the
SSL parameters from IO::Socket::SSL may also be specified.
See L<IO::Socket::SSL> for information on setting this up.

=head1 LICENCE

Distributed under the same terms as Net::Server

=head1 THANKS

Thanks to Vadim for pointing out the IO::Socket::SSL accept
was returning objects blessed into the wrong class.
