Net::Server::Fork - Net::Server personality

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Net::Server::Fork;
  @ISA = qw(Net::Server::Fork);

  sub process_request {
     #...code...
  }

  __PACKAGE__->run();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Please read the pod on Net::Server first.  This module
is a personality, or extension, or sub class, of the
Net::Server module.

This personality binds to one or more ports and then waits
for a client connection.  When a connection is received,
the server forks a child.  The child handles the request
and then closes.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item check_for_dead

Number of seconds to wait before looking for dead children.
This only takes place if the maximum number of child processes
(max_servers) has been reached.  Default is 60 seconds.

=item max_servers

The maximum number of children to fork.  The server will
not accept connections until there are free children. Default
is 256 children.

=item max_dequeue

The maximum number of dequeue processes to start.  If a
value of zero or undef is given, no dequeue processes will
be started.  The number of running dequeue processes will
be checked by the check_for_dead variable.

=item check_for_dequeue

Seconds to wait before forking off a dequeue process.  It
is intended to use the dequeue process to take care of
items such as mail queues.  If a value of undef is given,
no dequeue processes will be started.

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE

See L<Net::Server>.

=head1 PROCESS FLOW

Process flow follows Net::Server until the post_accept phase.
At this point a child is forked.  The parent is immediately
able to wait for another request.  The child handles the
request and then exits.

=head1 HOOKS

The Fork server has the following hooks in addition to
the hooks provided by the Net::Server base class.
See L<Net::Server>

=over 4

=item C<$self-E<gt>run_dequeue()>
