=head1 NAME

=begin original

autodie - Replace functions with ones that succeed or die with lexical scope

=end original

autodie - レキシカルスコープ内の関数を、成功しなければ die するものに置き換える

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use autodie;            # Recommended: implies 'use autodie qw(:default)'

    use autodie qw(:all);   # Recommended more: defaults and system/exec.

    use autodie qw(open close);   # open/close succeed or die

    open(my $fh, "<", $filename); # No need to check!

    {
        no autodie qw(open);          # open failures won't die
        open(my $fh, "<", $filename); # Could fail silently!
        no autodie;                   # disable all autodies
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

        bIlujDI' yIchegh()Qo'; yIHegh()!

        It is better to die() than to return() in failure.

                -- Klingon programming proverb.

=begin original

The C<autodie> pragma provides a convenient way to replace functions
that normally return false on failure with equivalents that throw
an exception on failure.

=begin original

The C<autodie> pragma has I<lexical scope>, meaning that functions
and subroutines altered with C<autodie> will only change their behaviour
until the end of the enclosing block, file, or C<eval>.

If C<system> is specified as an argument to C<autodie>, then it
uses L<IPC::System::Simple> to do the heavy lifting.  See the
description of that module for more information.

=head1 EXCEPTIONS

=begin original

Exceptions produced by the C<autodie> pragma are members of the
L<autodie::exception> class.  The preferred way to work with
these exceptions under Perl 5.10 is as follows:

=head1 CATEGORIES

=begin original

Autodie uses a simple set of categories to group together similar
built-ins.  Requesting a category type (starting with a colon) will
enable autodie for all built-ins beneath that category.  For example,
requesting C<:file> will enable autodie for C<close>, C<fcntl>,
C<fileno>, C<open> and C<sysopen>.
