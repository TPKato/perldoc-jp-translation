NAME
    Games::Go::SGF - Parse and dissect Standard Go Format files

SYNOPSIS
      use Games::Go::SGF;
      my $sgf = new Games::Go::SGF($sgfdata);
      print "Game played on ".$sgf->date."\n";
      print $sgf->white. " (W) vs. ".$sgf->black." (B)\n";
      print "Board size: ".$sgf->size.". Komi: ".$sgf->komi."\n";

      while ($move = $sgf->move($move_no++)) {
        print "$move_no: ".$move->move,"\n";
      }

DESCRIPTION
    This is a very simple SGF file parser, of currently limited
    functionality. It can read and step through SGF files, follow
    variations, and so on. It's good enough for getting simple statistics
    about games of Go, and building up "Games::Go::Board" objects
    representing games stored as SGF.

    "$sgf->move" returns either a normal "Games::Go::SGF::Node" or a
    "Games::Go::SGF::Variation" object. They behave exactly the same, but
    the variation object has the additional methods "mainline()" to get the
    main line of the game, "variation($n)" to get the first node in the n'th
    variation, and "variations" to retrieve an array of variations.
    "$variation->move" will, by default, follow the mainline.

TODO
    Better documentation is planned; as is the ability to write as well as
    read SGF files.
