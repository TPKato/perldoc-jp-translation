re - 正規表現の振る舞いを変えるための Perl プラグマ

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin original

    use re 'taint';
    ($x) = ($^X =~ /^(.*)$/s);     # $x is tainted here

=end original

    use re 'taint';
    ($x) = ($^X =~ /^(.*)$/s);     # $x はここで汚染されている

=begin original

    $pat = '(?{ $foo = 1 })';
    use re 'eval';
    /foo${pat}bar/;		   # won't fail (when not under -T switch)

=end original

    $pat = '(?{ $foo = 1 })';
    use re 'eval';
    /foo${pat}bar/;		   # 失敗しない (-T スイッチがないとき)

=begin original

    {
	no re 'taint';		   # the default
	($x) = ($^X =~ /^(.*)$/s); # $x is not tainted here

=end original

    {
	no re 'taint';		   # デフォルト
	($x) = ($^X =~ /^(.*)$/s); # $x はここで汚染されていない

=begin original

	no re 'eval';		   # the default
	/foo${pat}bar/;		   # disallowed (with or without -T switch)
    }

=end original

	no re 'eval';		   # デフォルト
	/foo${pat}bar/;		   # 許されない (-T スイッチの有無に関係なく)
    }

=begin original

    use re 'debug';		   # output debugging info during
    /^(.*)$/s;			   #     compile and run time

=end original

    use re 'debug';		   # コンパイル時と実行時に
    /^(.*)$/s;			   #     デバッグ情報を出力する


=begin original

    use re 'debugcolor';	   # same as 'debug', but with colored output
    ...

=end original

    use re 'debugcolor';	   # 'debug' と同じだが、出力に色がつく
    ...

    use re qw(Debug All);          # Finer tuned debugging options.
    use re qw(Debug More);
    no re qw(Debug ALL);           # Turn of all re debugging in this scope

    use re qw(is_regexp regexp_pattern); # import utility functions
    my ($pat,$mods)=regexp_pattern(qr/foo/i);
    if (is_regexp($obj)) { 
        print "Got regexp: ",
            scalar regexp_pattern($obj); # just as perl would stringify it
    }                                    # but no hassle with blessed re's.

=begin original

(We use $^X in these examples because it's tainted by default.)

=end original

(この例では、デフォルトで汚染されているので $^X を使いました)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 'taint' mode

=begin original

When C<use re 'taint'> is in effect, and a tainted string is the target
of a regex, the regex memories (or values returned by the m// operator
in list context) are tainted.  This feature is useful when regex operations
on tainted data aren't meant to extract safe substrings, but to perform
other transformations.

=end original

C<use re 'taint'> が有効で、汚染された文字列が正規表現の
ターゲットであるとき、正規表現のメモリー(もしくはリストコンテキストで
m// 演算子が返す値)は汚染されます。
この機能は汚染されたデータに対する正規表現演算が安全な部分文字列を
取り出すものでないときに便利ですが、その他の変換は働きます。

=head2 'eval' mode

=begin original

When C<use re 'eval'> is in effect, a regex is allowed to contain
C<(?{ ... })> zero-width assertions even if regular expression contains
variable interpolation.  That is normally disallowed, since it is a
potential security risk.  Note that this pragma is ignored when the regular
expression is obtained from tainted data, i.e.  evaluation is always
disallowed with tainted regular expressions.  See L<perlre/(?{ code })>.

=end original

C<use re 'eval'> が有効なとき、変数展開を含む正規表現でも
ゼロ幅表明 C<(?{ ... })> を持つことができます。
これは通常はセキュリティ上のリスクとなる可能性があるので許されていません。
このプラグマは正規表現が汚染されたデータからきたものである場合には
無視されることに注意してください。
つまり、汚染された正規表現を評価することは常に許されません。
L<perlre/(?{ code })> を参照してください。

=begin original

For the purpose of this pragma, interpolation of precompiled regular
expressions (i.e., the result of C<qr//>) is I<not> considered variable
interpolation.  Thus:

=end original

このプラグマの目的のため、プリコンパイルされた正規表現
(つまり、C<qr//> の結果)の展開(interpolation)は変数展開とは
I<みなされません>。
したがって:

    /foo${pat}bar/

=begin original

I<is> allowed if $pat is a precompiled regular expression, even
if $pat contains C<(?{ ... })> assertions.

=end original

は、$pat がプリコンパイルされた正規表現であれば、たとえ $pat が
C<(?{ ... })> 表明を含んでいたとしても I<許されます>。

=head2 'debug' mode

=begin original

When C<use re 'debug'> is in effect, perl emits debugging messages when
compiling and using regular expressions.  The output is the same as that
obtained by running a C<-DDEBUGGING>-enabled perl interpreter with the
B<-Dr> switch. It may be quite voluminous depending on the complexity
of the match.  Using C<debugcolor> instead of C<debug> enables a
form of output that can be used to get a colorful display on terminals
that understand termcap color sequences.  Set C<$ENV{PERL_RE_TC}> to a
comma-separated list of C<termcap> properties to use for highlighting
strings on/off, pre-point part on/off.
See L<perldebug/"Debugging regular expressions"> for additional info.

=end original

C<use re 'debug'> が有効なとき、perl は正規表現をコンパイルするときと
使うときにデバッグ用メッセージを出力します。
その出力は C<-DDEBUGGING> が有効になっている perl インタプリタに
B<-Dr> スイッチを与えたときと同じです。
これはマッチの複雑さに応じて非常に多弁になる可能性があります。
C<debug> の代わりに C<debugcolor> を使うと、termcap カラーシーケンスを
使ったカラフルな出力を端末に行います。
C<termcap> プロパティのカンマ区切りのリストを C<$ENV{PERL_RE_TC}> に
セットすることで、文字列のオン/オフや pre-point 部分のオン/オフを
ハイライトできます。

As of 5.9.5 the directive C<use re 'debug'> and its equivalents are
lexically scoped, as the other directives are.  However they have both 
compile-time and run-time effects.

Similarly C<use re 'Debug'> produces debugging output, the difference
being that it allows the fine tuning of what debugging output will be
emitted. Options are divided into three groups, those related to
compilation, those related to execution and those related to special
purposes. The options are as follows:

Because the C<here> is before the C<.*> in the pattern, its position

it could appear at any point after where the anchored string appeared.
Perl uses both for its optimisations, prefering the longer, or, if they are
equal, the floating.
